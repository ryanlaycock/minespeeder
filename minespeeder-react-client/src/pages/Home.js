            Minespeeder is a Minesweeper clone with a twist: it's multiplayer. 
            The first player to clear their board wins.
        </p>
        <p>
            Minespeeder is a work in progress. It's currently in a very early alpha state. 
            You can play it, but it's not very fun yet. 
            If you want to try it out, click the button below to create a game.
